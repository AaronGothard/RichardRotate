# RichardRotate
# Richard Rotate is a script that will rick-roll the user at max volume when they press win+j. Whatever use you find for it, have fun
# Download the file named "RichardRotate2.exe", or you can download the "RichardRotate2.ahk" file and convert it to an exe yourself since it's bad practice to download random excecutables off the internet.
